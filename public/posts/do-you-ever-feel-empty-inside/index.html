<p>I bet you do, but you probably won’t admit it. Maybe not even to yourself. It’s hard to accept your own problems, your own imperfection, the imperfection of your life. But still I am 100% certain that you can do it!</p>

<p>A lot of people I know, some of them really close friends to me have been trough all kinds of shit, I myself have aswell. I learned a lot on my way and I am trying to help as many people as I possibly can. I’ll try to write down some of my experiences in this post and more might follow.</p>

<h2 id="trust-yourself">Trust yourself</h2>

<p>Trust yourself. Your emotions. They are there to tell you what you feel, so you should listen to them. Listen. Do you hear it? Do you even really know yourself? Get to know yourself, your feelings and how to control them. Tell others what you like and don’t like. Be open. Trust your mind. Follow your dreams and thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="realizing-you-have-a-problem">Realizing you have a problem</h2>

<p>Reflect on yourself. Analyze your own feelings. Does something make you feel uncomfortable, what is it? Locate it, track it down. Accept that you have this problem and mentally prepare yourself for a change.</p>

<h2 id="talk">Talk</h2>

<p>Talk about your problem, it doesn’t really matter who you talk to as long as it is someone you can trust. Someone who doesn’t judge you for the things you tell them, someone who’s capable of listening. Tell them the truth you want them to know, it doesn’t neccessarily have to be the truth you experienced, but tell them enough that they can see your problem and support you in making a change.</p>

<h2 id="fill-the-emptiness">Fill the emptiness</h2>

<p>Distract yourself, find joy in small things. Enjoy things you used to enjoy as a child. Find new friends. Become a true fan of your favourite musician. Dedicate your life to this fandom. Read a book. Listen to calming music (thats what I am doing just as I am writing this piece). Help others struggling with similar problems. Get to know yourself better. Flirt. Write about your experiences, your problems, about helping other people. Find out if the illuminati is real (ok, for real now, do they exist?</p>
