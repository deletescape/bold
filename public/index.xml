      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying hard. Try to turn it off. My mind. Filled with thoughts I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna have. Can&amp;rsquo;t stop it. My mind keeps on thinking. Uncontrollable flow of useless informations. Useless pictures. Sadness. Forcing some happy memories on me. Happiness. I&amp;rsquo;m fully awake again now. I need a hug. Can&amp;rsquo;t this just stop. Trying to get it out of my head. I start to think about not thinking. Awake. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <title>I&#39;m split - Talking to myself</title>

      <description>It just happens&amp;hellip; I start to talk to myself. Anyone else listening to me would think it is only one person talking. But there is someone else. Only I can hear those answers. It&amp;rsquo;s thought person. He&amp;rsquo;s (inside) my mind. Speak person and Thought persons mainly have conversations when I&amp;rsquo;m alone at home over a longer time.
Most of their conversations are pretty random. There is no real theme to them.</description>

      <title>Do you ever feel empty inside?</title>

      <description>I bet you do, but you probably won’t admit it. Maybe not even to yourself. It’s hard to accept your own problems, your own imperfection, the imperfection of your life. But still I am 100% certain that you can do it!
A lot of people I know, some of them really close friends to me have been trough all kinds of shit, I myself have aswell. I learned a lot on my way and I am trying to help as many people as I possibly can.</description>

      <description>I just need to talk about my life somewhere, about my struggles and how I cope with them.
My life could be easier, but I can not change it. Not even everyone I know in person knows it but I am autistic, I have an Asperger Syndrome. But this isn’t my only health problem, I am a coeliac too, got some problems with my back and a chronic depression. Thats alot for a 17 years old teenager to handle, but somehow I can.</description>
