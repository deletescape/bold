I'm trying hard. Try to turn it off. My mind. Filled with thoughts I don't wanna have. Can't stop it. My mind keeps on thinking. Uncontrollable flow of useless informations. Useless pictures. Sadness. Forcing some happy memories on me. Happiness. I'm fully awake again now. I need a hug. Can't this just stop. Trying to get it out of my head. I start to think about not thinking. Awake. It doesn't work. Frustration. I start to move around. This just wakes me up even more. I don't get how other people just fall asleep instantly. Why can't I be like them. I hate them. Their life is so much easier. I can't sleep. Crazy ideas form in my head. I want to save them somehow so I will remember them later. I forgot my idea already. It's gone. Where the fuck is the mute button for my thoughts.
